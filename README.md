## Running

```bash
make
```

## TO DO:

* ~~Make a menu to start the game~~
* ~~Scroll the background. That'd be cool~~
* Do something when the player kills all the invaders
* Blow up the ship when the invaders hit the bottom
* Add an explosion when an invader dies
* Add multiple levels where invaders get faster
* Add sound effects
* Maybe some music too...
* And animation...
